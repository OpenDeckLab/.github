# OpenDeckLab
OpenDeckLab is a github organization around simulations of engines and turbomachines. For now on, only one repository ([OpenDeckSMR](https://github.com/OpenDeckLab/OpenDeckSMR)) is active. Some new repositories will be added in the future to enrich the project.


# Other repositories in the same thematics
If you are interested in the subject of generating data for turbomachines, please have a look at the following repositories:
- [MTS-CGAN](https://github.com/MadaneA/MTS-CGAN): Transformer-based Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Multivariate Time Series Generation. The model is designed for the conditional generation of realistic multivariate time series data.
- [T-MATS](https://github.com/nasa/T-MATS/releases): NASA Matlab Toolbox for the Modeling and Analysis of Thermodynamic Systems
